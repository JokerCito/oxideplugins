**Reserved** sets aside a configurable number of slots so that select players can connect even when the server has the maximum number of regular players connected.

**Permissions**

This plugin uses Oxide's permission system. To assign a permission, use **grant user <username|steamid> <permission>**. To remove a permission, use **revoke user <username|steamid> <permission>**.
