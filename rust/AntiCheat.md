Anti Wallhack:

Detects players that try to go through walls or doors

floors detect wallhackers that go UP not DOWN


Anti Wallhack Kills:

Should detect kills that were made through wallhack, detecting will show admins the detection & cancel the kill


Anti Speedhack:

Detects players that are moving too fast >10m/s as default

Anti Flyhack:

Detects players that are in the air and moving freely (so not falling)

Anti Melee Speed:

detect players that hit too fast with melee weapons

Cancels Damage

Anti Melee Over Range:

FIXED BY GARRY

Visual Logs:

Glitchy for the moment as you have to spam the commands to keep the logs going, i'll work on something to keep it showing when i find out how

I recommend that you daily check all your hack detections and remove/reset the logs to prevent the logs from getting too big

to easily get player detections by name i STRONGLY recommend you to install: [DeadPlayersList](http://oxidemod.org/plugins/deadplayerslist.696/) 2.0.4


Please give me feedback on errors and fail/good bans


Know Issues:

1) HELPPP everybody is getting Punished!!!!

- Check if you can still build on your server

If not, it means you've reached the max allowed entities from unity engine, a wipe is necessary, nothing else can be done.

- Check your colliders ("colliders" in the SERVER console, not player), if it's over 260 000, a wipe is needed, nothing else can be done.

- If you don't enter in both categories above, unload the plugin, seems like you have a bug on your server (or a lot of cheaters). Try using the plugin on next server wipe.
