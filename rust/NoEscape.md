Raid Block

Detects when a raid is occurring and block players from using teleport (or remover tool).


The raid "participants" whom may be blocked:

* The owner of the base
* The nearby clan-mates of the owner
* The nearby friends of the owner
* The raid initiator
* The nearby clan-mates of the raid initiator
* The nearby friends of the raid initiator
* Anyone nearby (including raiders and bystanders)

* raidBlock will detect raids and dispense command blocks depending on a variety of circumstances.
* ownerBlock will check if the owner of the damaged block is within the configured distance, they are blocked for the configured duration.
* clanShare will check if any clan-mates within configured distance and block them for the configured duration.
* friendShare will check if any friends within configured distance and block them for the configured duration.
* clanCheck will prevent clan-mates from blocking eachother accidentally.
* friendCheck will prevent friends from blocking eachother accidentally.
* blockAll will block everyone within configured distance for the configured duration. Note: this option overrides ownerBlock, friendShare, clanShare and raiderBlock entirely.
